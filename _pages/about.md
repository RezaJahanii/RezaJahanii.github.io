Hey! I'm Reza. I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran. I started my journey in Ph.D. studies in Jan 2025.

My research lies at the intersection of Wireless Networks and Machine Learning, currently focusing on Federated Learning and Distributed Optimization. I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree under supervision of Professor <a href="https://hdai.wordpress.ncsu.edu/" style="color: #0056b3;">Huaiyu Dai</a>. 

I like to go on hikes and hit the gym regularly. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things specially Quantum Physics. I love to read books and watch movies.
